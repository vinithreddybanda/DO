## DevOps Lifecycle: Key Stages

DevOps is not just a set of practices, but a continuous lifecycle that integrates development and operations. The main stages are:

1. **Plan:** Define requirements, user stories, and tasks (Agile boards, Jira, Trello).
2. **Code:** Develop software using version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab).
3. **Build:** Compile code, run static analysis, package artifacts (Maven, Gradle, npm).
4. **Test:** Automated/unit/integration testing (JUnit, Selenium, pytest).
5. **Release:** Prepare and approve releases (Release pipelines, approvals).
6. **Deploy:** Automated deployment to environments (Jenkins, ArgoCD, Spinnaker).
7. **Operate:** Run and monitor applications (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud platforms).
8. **Monitor:** Collect logs, metrics, and feedback (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog).
9. **Feedback:** Use monitoring and user feedback to improve the next cycle.

## Key DevOps Practices

- Developers merge code changes frequently into a shared repository.
- Automated builds and tests run on every commit.
- Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.

### 2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- Code is automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production.
- Continuous Deployment: Every change that passes tests is deployed automatically.
- Tools: Spinnaker, ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Manage and provision infrastructure using code and automation.
- Enables versioning, repeatability, and rapid environment creation.
- Tools: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Pulumi.

### 4. Automated Testing
- Unit, integration, security, and performance tests are automated.
- Ensures quality and reduces manual effort.

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- Collect and analyze logs, metrics, and traces for performance and reliability.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic.

### 6. Collaboration & Communication
- Use of chat tools (Slack, MS Teams), wikis, and dashboards for transparency.

---

## 1. Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a cultural and professional movement that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between software developers (Dev), IT operations (Ops), and Quality Assurance (QA). Its goal is to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality by breaking down traditional silos and automating the software delivery process.

**Key Principles:**
- **Collaboration:** Dev, Ops, and QA work together as a single team.
- **Automation:** Repetitive tasks (build, test, deploy) are automated.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Monitoring and feedback loops drive improvement.
- **Shared Responsibility:** All team members are responsible for quality and stability.

**DevOps = Dev + Ops + QA + Automation + Collaboration + Feedback**

---

## 2. DevOps Perspective

### The Problem with Traditional IT
Traditional software development is characterized by:
- Siloed teams (Dev, QA, Ops, Security)
- Manual handoffs and processes
- Slow, error-prone releases
- Poor communication and blame-shifting

**Silo Mentality:**
Teams work in isolation, leading to miscommunication, delays, and inefficiencies. For example, developers may finish code and "throw it over the wall" to operations, who then struggle to deploy and maintain it.

**DevOps Perspective:**
- Breaks down silos
- Encourages cross-functional teams
- Automates the entire software delivery pipeline
- Focuses on delivering value to the customer quickly and safely

**Analogy:** Building a house where all workers (builders, electricians, painters) coordinate and communicate, rather than working in isolation.

---

## 3. DevOps and Agile

### Agile Overview
Agile is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration. Agile focuses on iterative development, customer feedback, and adaptability.

**Popular Agile Frameworks:**
- Scrum
